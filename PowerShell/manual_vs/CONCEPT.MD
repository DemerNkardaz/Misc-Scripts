# Manual Interface for Scripts

The concept idea to create executable file with own script versions and options to control it:

* Choose target folder from window for copy names or structure
* Choose target folder from window for insert folders (Create Folders from Clipboard & JSON scripts)
* Choose output filename and extensions
* Copy to clipboard from one of options
* Frame for paste JSON structure from clipboard
* Actions to select ready html or json files to create folders structure
* Maybe additional selectors for wrap names in html to additional tag (i.e. create just ul>li list or wrap names to `<span>`, `<a>` etc.)
